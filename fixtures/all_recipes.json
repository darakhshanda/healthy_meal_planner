If you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven.",

Avoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy.",

Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil. Place cut-side down on the grill plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes. Gently turn over and season again. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape.",
      "For the black pudding, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin. Place on the grill plate and cook for 1½-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy.",
      "For 'proper' fried bread it's best to cook it in a separate pan. Ideally, use bread that is a couple of days old. Heat a frying pan to a medium heat and cover the base with oil. Add the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden. If the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil. For a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice.",
      "For the fried eggs, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and leave for 30 seconds. Add a good knob of butter and lightly splash/baste the egg with the butter when melted. Cook to your preferred stage, season and gently remove with a fish slice.",
      "Once all the ingredients are cooked, serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of tomato ketchup or brown sauce."

      "KNOW HOW: HOW TO COOK IT: Cooking barramundi on the bone, as we have done here, has its advantages – it will stay more moist during cooking, and some would say that the flavour is enhanced, too. If you want to take out the bones they are easy to locate and less likely to be lodged in the fillet if the fish is cooked whole. Fillets can be simply pan-fried or grilled. If you like trout, you will really enjoy the flavour of barramundi, which lends itself to similar ingredients and cooking methods – citrus flavours are particularly good, as are garlic and wild mushrooms. Simply roasting the fish with some fresh herbs, olive oil and seasoning is delicious, and in the summer months you could barbecue it, too. One thing that you mustn’t miss are the cheeks or ‘pearls’ of the fish, these are simply lovely, moist and really sweet – well worth leaving the head on for!"

      "Prepare the Fire: Start a wood fire in your grill and let it burn down to coals.",

      "Grill the Meat: Place the beef on the grill, starting with the thickest cuts farthest from the coals. Add chorizo and morcilla after the beef has been cooking for a while.",
      "Cook to Perfection: Cook the meat, turning occasionally, until it reaches your desired doneness. Typically, ribs may take up to 2 hours; thinner cuts will cook faster.",
      "Rest and Serve: Let the meat rest for about 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with chimichurri sauce and grilled vegetables.",
      "Pro Tips:",
      "Use a mix of wood and charcoal for a consistent heat source. Wood adds flavor, while charcoal maintains temperature.",
      "Season the meat just before grilling to ensure it retains its moisture and flavor.",
      "Serving Suggestions:",
      "Serve with a side of chimichurri sauce, a fresh tomato salad, and crusty bread. Pair with a robust Malbec wine to complement the rich flavors of the meat."
