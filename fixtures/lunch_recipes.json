      "instructions": "1. step 1\n2. Tip all the dressing ingredients into a food processor with a pinch of salt and blitz to a dressing. Slash the fish three times on each side, coat with half of the dressing, then set aside to marinate for about 30 mins.\n3. step 2\n4. Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Place the fish on a roasting tray, then cook in the oven for 20 mins until the flesh is firm and the eyes have turned white. Serve the fish with the rest of the dressing and steamed couscous or rice.\n5. step 3\n6. KNOW HOW: HOW TO COOK IT: Cooking barramundi on the bone, as we have done here, has its advantages – it will stay more moist during cooking, and some would say that the flavour is enhanced, too. If you want to take out the bones they are easy to locate and less likely to be lodged in the fillet if the fish is cooked whole. Fillets can be simply pan-fried or grilled. If you like trout, you will really enjoy the flavour of barramundi, which lends itself to similar ingredients and cooking methods – citrus flavours are particularly good, as are garlic and wild mushrooms. Simply roasting the fish with some fresh herbs, olive oil and seasoning is delicious, and in the summer months you could barbecue it, too. One thing that you mustn’t miss are the cheeks or ‘pearls’ of the fish, these are simply lovely, moist and really sweet – well worth leaving the head on for!",

Whisk together and bring to a simmer.\n3. Combine the cornstarch and water in a small bowl and whisk to dissolve. Add to the saucepan and whisk until the gravy thickens and coats the back of the spoon, 2 to 3 minutes. Cover the saucepan with a lid and keep it warm on the lowest possible heat.\n4. Make the egg foo young batter:\n5. In a medium bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and water until dissolved. Add the eggs, salt, and sugar. Whisk until well combined and there are no more egg white clumps.\n6. Add the green onion, bean sprouts, and shrimp. Stir until everything is evenly coated.\n7. Fry the egg foo young:\n8. Add the vegetable oil to a large wok; it should reach about 2 inches up the sides. Heat the oil over medium-high heat to 350°F, or until vigorous bubbles form around an inserted wooden chopstick.\n9. With a ladle, gently and slowly add 1/4 of the omelet batter. Egg foo young should immediately bubble and puff up like magic. Fry until golden brown and crispy on each side, about 2 minutes per side. If there are any light spots, use a ladle to gently baste it with hot oil.\n10. Tip\n11. Egg foo young can be a bit tricky to flip. The easiest method is to put a tool in each hand (a spider, slotted spoon, tongs, and large chopsticks are all good candidates) and gently coax the omelet over, pulling up on one side and pushing down and around on the other.\n12. Remove the omelet and place it on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Let it cool for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, repeat with the remaining batter to make 4 omelets. If needed, add more oil to the pan between batches.\n13. Serve and enjoy:\n14. Plate each egg foo young over a bed of rice. Spoon the warm gravy over the top and serve immediately.",

Fry the shells in 1 tbsp oil for 5 mins, until dark pink and golden in patches. Add the wine, boil down by two thirds, then pour in the stock. Strain into a jug, discarding the shells.\n2. Heat the rest of the oil in a deep frying pan or casserole. Add the fennel, onion and garlic, season, then cover and gently cook for 10 mins until softened. Meanwhile, peel the potato and cut into 2cm-ish chunks. Put into a pan of cold water, bring to the boil and cook for 5 mins until almost tender. Drain in a colander.\n3. Peel a strip of zest from the orange. Put the zest, star anise, bay and ½ tsp harissa into the pan. Fry gently, uncovered, for 5-10 mins, until the vegetables are soft, sweet and golden.\n4. Stir in the tomato purée, cook for 2 mins, then add the tomatoes and stock. Simmer for 10 mins until the sauce thickens slightly. Season to taste. The sauce can be made ahead, then reheated later in the day. Meantime, scrub the mussels or clams and pull away any stringy beards. Any that are open should be tapped sharply on the worktop – if they don’t close after a few seconds, discard them.\n5. Reheat the sauce if necessary, then stir the potato, chunks of fish and prawns very gently into the stew. Bring back to the boil, then cover and gently simmer for 3 mins. Scatter the mussels or clams over the stew, then cover and cook for 2 mins more or until the shells have opened wide. Discard any that remain closed. The chunks of fish should flake easily and the prawns should be pink through. Scatter with the thyme leaves.\n6. To make the quick rouille, stir the rest of the harissa through the mayonnaise. Serve the stew in bowls, topped with spoonfuls of rouille, which will melt into the sauce and enrich it. Have some good bread ready, as you’ll definitely want to mop up the juices.",

Pour some oil into a large pan until it comes about 7cm up the sides, but the pan is no more than a third full. Place over a medium heat and let the oil warm up. To test that the oil is ready, place a small piece of bread in the pan – it should sizzle when it touches the oil.\n5. step 3\n6. Remove a handful of squid from the flour and shake off any excess. Gently drop into the oil, then cook for about 3 mins until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on kitchen paper. Repeat with the remaining squid. Serve straight away with the mayonnaise and lemon wedges.",

While the sauce is simmering, the prawns should become cool enough to handle. First remove the legs by pinching them, and then pull off the shells, leaving the head and tail on.\n4. When the sauce has thickened, stir in the prawns. Bring to a simmer again if the sauce has cooled with the prawns, and cook for about 5 minutes. Add the feta and remove from the heat. Let stand until the cheese starts to melt. Serve warm with slices of crusty bread.\n5.
